/**
 * This command is used to tell the flash loader device to reset. This is useful when downloading a
 * new image that overwrote the flash loader and wants to start from a full reset. Unlike the
 * COMMAND_RUN command, this allows the initial stack pointer to be read by the hardware and set
 * up for the new code. It can also be used to reset the flash loader if a critical error occurs and the
 * host device wants to restart communication with the flash loader.
 * <p>
 * Byte[0] = 3
 * Byte[1] = checksum(Byte[2])
 * Byte[2] = COMMAND_RESET
 * <p>
 * The flash loader responds with an ACK signal back to the host device before actually executing the
 * software reset to the device running the flash loader. This allows the host to know that the command
 * was received successfully and the part will be reset.
