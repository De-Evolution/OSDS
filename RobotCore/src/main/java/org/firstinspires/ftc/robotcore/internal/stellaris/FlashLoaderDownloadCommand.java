/**
 * This command is sent to the flash loader to indicate where to store data and how many bytes will
 * be sent by the COMMAND_SEND_DATA commands that follow. The command consists of two 32-bit
 * values that are both transferred MSB first. The first 32-bit value is the address to start programming
 * data into, while the second is the 32-bit size of the data that will be sent. This command also triggers
 * an erase of the full area to be programmed so this command takes longer than other commands.
 * This results in a longer time to receive the ACK/NAK back from the board. This command should
 * be followed by a COMMAND_GET_STATUS to ensure that the Program Address and Program size
 * are valid for the device running the flash loader.
