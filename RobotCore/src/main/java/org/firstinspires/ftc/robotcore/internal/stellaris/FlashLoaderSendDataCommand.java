/**
 * This command should only follow a COMMAND_DOWNLOAD command or another
 * COMMAND_SEND_DATA command if more data is needed. Consecutive send data commands
 * automatically increment address and continue programming from the previous location. The caller
 * should limit transfers of data to a maximum 8 bytes of packet data to allow the flash to program
 * successfully and not overflow input buffers of the serial interfaces. The command terminates
 * programming once the number of bytes indicated by the COMMAND_DOWNLOAD command has been
 * received. Each time this function is called it should be followed by a COMMAND_GET_STATUS to
 * ensure that the data was successfully programmed into the flash. If the flash loader sends a NAK
 * to this command, the flash loader does not increment the current address to allow retransmission
 * of the previous data.
