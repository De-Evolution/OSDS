/**
 * This command simply accepts the command and sets the global status to success. The format of
 * the packet is as follows:
 * Byte[0] = 0x03;
 * Byte[1] = checksum(Byte[2]);
 * Byte[2] = COMMAND_PING;
 * The ping command has 3 bytes and the value for COMMAND_PING is 0x20 and the checksum of one
 * byte is that same byte, making Byte[1] also 0x20. Since the ping command has no real return status,
 * the receipt of an ACK can be interpreted as a successful ping to the flash loader.
