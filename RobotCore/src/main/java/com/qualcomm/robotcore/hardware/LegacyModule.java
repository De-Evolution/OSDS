/**
 * Legacy Module for working with NXT devices.
 * <p>
 * The Modern Robotics Core Legacy Module provides backward compatibility to enable LEGO NXT devices
 * to connect to an Android device or a PC via a USB connection. Each Legacy Module has six (6) ports and
 * virtually any combination of devices can be connected to the module.
 * <p>
 * The Legacy Module firmware supports all NXT LEGO sensors (except the Lego Color Sensor),
 * HiTechnic sensors, Matrix controllers as well as the HiTechnic Tetrix motor and servo controllers.
 * <p>
 * Each Legacy Module port can operate in digital as well as analog modes. In digital mode, legacy
 * connector pins 5 and 6 can be set to logic 0 or logic 1.
 * <p>
 * In analog mode, the voltage on legacy connector pin 1 is measured using a 10 bit analog to digital
 * converter. Additionally, pins 5 and 6 can be set to logic 0 or logic 1 for control of the attached
 * device, such as a LEGO light sensor which uses pin 5 to turn the sensor LED on and off.
 * <p>
 * In I2C mode, legacy connector pins 5 and 6 are used to communicate with I2C devices in accordance
 * with the LEGO interpretation of I2C. Ports 4 and 5 can additionally be switched into pin 1 9v
 * supply mode to permit LEGO ultrasonic range sensors to be used
 *
 * @see <a href="http://www.modernroboticsinc.com/core-legacy-module-3">Modern Robotics Legacy Module</a>
