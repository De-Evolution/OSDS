/**
 * This interface can be used to control the activeness or aliveness of an object that controls
 * a piece of hardware such as a motor or servo controller. The object can be transitioned
 * amongst a series of states in which various degrees of functionality are available. The
 * states are as follows:
 * <p>
 * armed:       the object controlling the hardware is fully functional in its intended, usual way.
 * In this state, the object 'owns' full control of the hardware it represents.
 * <p>
 * disarmed:    the object is quiescent, not manipulating or controlling the hardware. In this state,
 * it is conceivable that some *other* object instance might be created and then be
 * successfully armed on the same underlying hardware. In contrast, it is not expected
 * that two object instances may be simultaneously armed against the same piece of
 * hardware.
 * <p>
 * pretending:  the object pretends as best it can to act as if it were armed on an actual
 * underlying piece of hardware, but in reality the object is just making it all up:
 * writes may be sent to the bit-bucket, reads might always return zeros, and so on.
 * Though this may sound odd, having a hardware-controlling object function in this mode
 * might minimize impact on upper software layers in the event that the desired actual
 * hardware is disconnected or otherwise unavailable.
 * <p>
 * closed:      this is much like disarmed, but more serious and permanent shutdown steps might
 * be taken as an object transitions to the closed state.
 * <p>
 * Transient 'toX' states are also present. The legal state transitions are as follows:
 * <p>
 * disarmed -> toArmed
 * toArmed -> armed
 * <p>
 * disarmed -> toPretending
 * toPretending -> pretending
 * <p>
 * armed -> toDisarmed
 * toArmed -> toDisarmed
 * pretending -> toDisarmed
 * toPretending -> toDisarmed
 * toDisarmed -> disarmed
 * <p>
 * armed -> closed
 * toArmed -> closed
 * pretending -> closed
 * toPretending -> closed
 * toDisarmed -> closed
 * disarmed -> closed
 * <p>
 * Notice that once closed, no further state transitions are possible. Conversely, it is possible
 * to close from any state and to disarm from any state except from closed. In particular, it is
 * possible to close or disarm from the transitional toArmed and toPretending states:
 * implementations *must* take care to ensure this is always possible.
 * <p>
 * Typically, when first instantiated, an object is in the disarmed state.
 * <p>
 * Objects should, generally, minimize the time they are in the disarmed state, as to many clients
 * they will appear dysfunctional and error prone in that state, since those clients may not have
 * been coded correctly to deal with an object that doesn't service read()s or write()s *at*all*.
