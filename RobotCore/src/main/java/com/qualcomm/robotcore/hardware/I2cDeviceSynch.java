/**
 * {@link I2cDeviceSynch} is an interface that exposes functionality for interacting with I2c
 * devices. Its methods are synchronous, in that they complete their action before returning to the
 * caller.
 * <p>
 * <p>Methods are provided to read and write data simply and straightforwardly. Singleton bytes
 * or larger quantities of data can be read or written using {@link #read8(int) read8()} and
 * {@link #write8(int, int) write8()} or {@link #read(int, int) read()} and {@link #write(int, byte[]) write()}
 * respectively. No attention to 'read mode' or 'write mode' is required. Simply call reads
 * and writes as you need them, and the right thing happens.
 * <p>
 * <p>For devices that automatically shutdown if no communication is received within a certain
 * duration, a heartbeat facility is optionally provided.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>On causality: regarding the sequencing of reads and writes, two important points are
 * worthy of mention. First, reads and writes are ultimately issued to the controller in the same
 * chronological order they were received by the device client instance. Second, even more
 * importantly, reads *always* see the effect of preceding writes on the controller. That is,
 * a read that follows a write will ensure that, first, the write gets issued to the controller, and
 * then, second, a read from the controller is subsequently issued. By contrast, absent such
 * constraints, a read might quickly return freshly-read data already present without having to
 * interact with the controller. Which brings us to...</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Reading data. The simplest way to read data is to call one of the variations of the
 * {@link #read(int, int) read()} method. This is always correct, and will return data as accessed
 * from the I2c device. However, in many situations, reads can be significantly optimized by use
 * of a <em>read window</em>. With a read window, a larger chunk of the device's I2c register space
 * can be automatically read even if only a portion of it is needed to service a particular read()
 * call; this can make subsequent read()s significantly faster. Further, depending on the mode
 * of {@link com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.I2cDeviceSynch.ReadWindow ReadWindow} used, read
 * operations will occur in the background, and read()s will be serviced (subject to causality) out
 * of cached data updated and maintained by the background processing without any synchronous
 * communication with the I2c device itself. For sensors in particular, this mode of operation
 * can be particularly advantageous.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Three modes of {@link com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.I2cDeviceSynch.ReadWindow ReadWindow} are
 * available:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link ReadMode#REPEAT REPEAT}. In this
 * mode, background reads are always scheduled and cached data updated whenever there's no other
 * (writing) work to do. This is the mode commonly used by sensors, who mostly execute reads
 * and only issue a write relatively infrequently.</li>
 * <li>{@link ReadMode#BALANCED BALANCED}. In this
 * mode, background reads are also performed, but only if the user initiates a manual read first after
 * a write operation. The object does not automatically start background reads on its own, as the
 * transition from writing to reading can be a relatively expensive one. This mode can be useful
 * for objects like motor and servo controllers which exhibit a balanced mix of both write and
 * read operations</li>
 * <li>{@link ReadMode#ONLY_ONCE ONLY_ONCE}. In this
 * mode, no background reading is performed; data is always retrieved with a synchronous
 * communication to the i2c device.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <p>An {@link I2cDeviceSynch} has only one read window in effect at any particular time. This can
 * be updated with {@link #setReadWindow(ReadWindow)} or {@link #ensureReadWindow(ReadWindow, ReadWindow) ensureReadWindow()}.
 * When a read() is made, if the registers requested therein are contained within the current
 * read window, then that whole window of data is read from the i2c device (if the cache is out
 * of date) and the appropriate portion thereof returned. In contrast, if the requested registers
 * are not so contained, then, in effect, a one-off {@link ReadMode#ONLY_ONCE ONLY_ONCE}
 * is used without disturbing the window maintained by {@link #setReadWindow(ReadWindow)}.
 * </p>
