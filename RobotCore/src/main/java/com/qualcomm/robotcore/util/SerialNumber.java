 * Instances of {@link SerialNumber} represent serial numbers of devices on the USB bus.
 * 'Fake' serial numbers are serial numbers that will *never* appear for a real device; they
 * are useful, for example, as the serial number of a {@link ControllerConfiguration} that
 * has not yet been associated with a actual USB controller device.
 * <p>
 * Note that *all* serial numbers loaded in memory at any given instant are guaranteed unique and
 * different, even the fake ones; this allows code that processes USB-device-bound {@link
 * ControllerConfiguration}s to operate easily on unbound ones as well, a significant coding
 * simplification. The technology used in fake serial numbers, {@link UUID}s, in fact guarantees
 * uniqueness across space and time, so fake serial numbers can be recorded persistently and
 * still maintain uniqueness. Historically, non-unique 'fake' serial numbers were also used: these
 * appeared int the form of "-1" or "N/A". When loaded from persistent storage, such legacy
 * fake serial numbers are converted to unique ones to maintain the uniqueness guarantee.
