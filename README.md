# Open Source Driver Station (OSDS)

This app is an open-source version of the FTC 2015-16 Driver Station app in the Play Store.  It is based off of the beta Driver Station source code distributed to teams at preview events. I combined it with the up-to-date backend libraries taken from the FTC SDK, as well as some decompiled bits of the Play Store Driver Station code to create a modified driver station which works with the current Robot Controller app.

### Code Ownership
The GUI source code in this was written by Qualcomm and modified by me.  It is still their property.  The `FtcCommon` and `RobotCore` libraries are both taken in their compiled form from the ftc_sdk project.

### Pros & Cons
#### Why you WOULD use this driver station
- It supports a larger range of devices and screen sizes than the default app (though it won't magically fix Wifi Direct on devices where it is broken or not present)
- It gives you quite a bit more screen real estate for Telemetry, depending on the size of your device's screen
- It allows you to customize your team's DS.  You can do simple color and icon theming, or something as complicated as parsing the Telemetry feed and creating a GUI for your robot.
- It supports LAN mode, which lets you connect to the robot by joining the same wifi network and typing in the IP address, instead of futzing around with Wifi Direct
- It features a much less jarring and aggressive "Configuring Wifi, please wait..." dialog, which hopefully won't get stuck in a loop.
- It includes the old, device-agnostic (though root-requiring) Wifi channel changer.  Changing the driver station channel doesn't have any effect, but I suppose you could install OSDS on our robot controller phone and use it there.

#### Why you WOULDN'T use this driver station
- I have NO IDEA if it is at all competition legal, or will work at competition.  Make sure to keep a supported driver station device for competition use.
- It may be buggier than the official DS, as the GUI was not originally meant to work with this version of the backend library.
- Maybe you really like the official DS's color scheme?
