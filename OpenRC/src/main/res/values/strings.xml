    <string name="openRcSummary">
        OpenRC is a modified version of the ftc_app software created by members of the OpenFTC
        community. The goal of OpenRC is to improve the development experience for teams, while providing a quick-and-easy
        path to install a competition-legal version of the app.

        \n\nThe GDC has ruled that OpenRC is NOT legal for competition use, and the user acknowledged this fact the first
        time they launched this app. For more information, visit http://openftc.org/OpenRC/legality
