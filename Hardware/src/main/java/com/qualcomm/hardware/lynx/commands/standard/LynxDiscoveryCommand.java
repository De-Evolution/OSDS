/**
 * Performs discovery respecting half-duplex aspect of EIA485 communications link. This message is
 * sent to the broadcast address 0xFF. If this message arrives via USB, the Controller Module knows
 * it is USB-connected (a Parent) and may have children on its 485 bus. The Parent issues its own
 * Discovery Response and then takes ownership of the 485 bus. The Parent sends Discovery packets
 * directly to all possible Child addresses (1 ~ 254) in sequence, waiting 2 msec (1kHz system clock
 * guarantees that to be between 1 ~ 2 msec) between each. Any connected Child should respond to
 * the Discovery packet effectively immediately, taking brief control over the child bus to do so.
 * Discovery completes in about 500msec.
 * <p>
 * Once discovered, a Child requires a Keep Alive addressed directly to it (rather than a broadcast
 * message) within the usual KA interval to lock in the child status. If no Keep Alive is received
 * by the Child in time, it reverts to ready-to-discover mode.
 * <p>
 * The discovery packet is sent from the host to the broadcast address (255). Note that the message
 * number of a broadcast message is completely ignored by receivers, as it cannot be guaranteed
 * to be a non-duplicate across all receivers.
 * <p>
 * Note that sending a LynxDiscoveryCommand can in theory result in up to 254 response messages; thus
 * the 'finished' processing of LynxDiscoveryCommands will be special. First, an incoming
 * LynxDiscoveryResponse should be processed unilaterally; the original LynxDiscoveryCommand will NOT
 * have a response expected (nor will it be ackable). Second, after sending a LynxDiscoveryCommand we
 * will wait for a sufficient time to receive all possible responses before ever sending any further
 * messages.
